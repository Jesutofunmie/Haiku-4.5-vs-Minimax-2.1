## Key Findings

### 1. Accuracy Parity
Both models achieved **100% accuracy** on all tasks, including:
- Bug detection and fixing (C1)
- Multi-step pipelines where errors compound (C4)
- Algorithm implementation with tricky edge cases (C7)
- Test-driven implementation (C3)

### 2. Speed Advantage: Haiku
Haiku is consistently **1.4-2x faster** across all task types:
- Simple file ops: 2x faster
- Code generation: 1.6x faster
- Complex reasoning: 1.5x faster

### 3. Tool Usage
Both models correctly use tools (read, write, bash, edit) without hallucination.
No fabricated results observed in 54 runs.

### 4. Self-Verification
Both models spontaneously verify their work (e.g., reading files after writing).

---

## Interesting Observations

### Alternative Solutions
In C1 (debug task), MiniMax found a **different but equally valid fix**:
- Expected: `window_start = max(window_start, char_index[char] + 1)`
- MiniMax alternative: `if char in char_index and char_index[char] >= window_start:`

Both solutions are correct, showing the models can reason about the problem rather than pattern-matching.

### Consistent Behavior
Both models showed 100% consistency - no flaky failures across multiple runs.

---

## Recommendations

### Use MiniMax M2.1 when:
- ✅ Cost is the primary concern
- ✅ Latency tolerance is 1.5x baseline
- ✅ Tasks are well-defined with clear success criteria

### Use Claude Haiku when:
- ✅ Speed is critical
- ✅ Running many parallel agents
- ✅ User-facing latency matters

### Both are suitable for:
- ✅ File operations and code generation
- ✅ Bug detection and fixing
- ✅ Multi-step data processing
- ✅ Algorithm implementation
- ✅ Error handling and recovery

## Limitations of This Benchmark

Tasks that might show differentiation but weren't tested:
1. **Very long context** (>100K tokens)
2. **Creative/subjective tasks** (no single right answer)
3. **Ambiguous requirements** (require judgment)
4. **Multi-turn conversations** (>10 turns)
5. **Domain-specific knowledge** (specialized domains)

---

## Conclusion

**MiniMax M2.1 is a viable alternative to Claude Haiku for agentic workflows.**

The ~1.6x speed difference is the main trade-off. For batch processing or cost-sensitive applications, MiniMax offers equivalent capability at potentially lower cost.
